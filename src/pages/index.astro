    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2-3 large eggs</li>
      <li>Salt, to taste</li>
      <li>Pepper, to taste</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon of butter or oil</li>
      <li>Optional fillings: cheese, diced vegatables, cooked meats, herbs</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <span>Beat the eggs:</span>In a bowl, beat the eggs with a pinch of salt
        and pepper until they are well mixed. You can add a tablespoon of water
        or milk for a fluffier texture.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Heat the pan:</span>Place a non-stick frying pan over medium heat
        and add butter or oil.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Cook the omelette:</span>Once the butter is melted and bubbling,
        pour in the eggs. Tilt the pan to ensure the eggs evenly coat the
        surface.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Add fillings (optional):</span>When the eggs begin to set at the
        edges but are still slightly runny in the middle, sprinkle your chosen
        fillings over one half of the omelette.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Fold and serve:</span>As the omelette continues to cook, carefully
        lift one edge and fold it over the fillings. Let it cook for another
        minute, then slide it onto a plate.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span>Enjoy:</span>Serve hot, with additional salt and pepper if needed.
      </li>
